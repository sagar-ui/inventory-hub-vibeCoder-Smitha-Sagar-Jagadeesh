# Project Apex: The Intelligent Inventory Hub  
  
## The Vision  
Every growing business hits a wall: messy spreadsheets, lost notes, and zero visibility into their most valuable assetâ€”their inventory. Our mission is to build a beautiful, fast, and intuitive dashboard that empowers business owners to manage their stock with zero friction.  
  
## Your Core Mission: Build the MVP  
Your goal is to build a single-page web application that delivers on this core user story:  
  
"As a store manager, I want to see all my items in a central dashboard, be able to add, update, and remove stock instantly, and get quick insights into my inventory's health, so I can make smarter decisions and stop wasting time on manual data entry."  
  
## MVP Requirements (The "Must-Haves")  
  
### 1. The Dashboard View:  
- **Key Stats:** A header showing Total Unique Items, Items Low on Stock, and Items Out of Stock.  
- **The Inventory Table:** A clean, sortable table displaying all items.  
- **Essential Columns:** Name, SKU, Category, Price, Quantity.  
- **Search & Filter:** A single search bar that can filter the table in real-time.  
  
### 2. Core CRUD Functionality:  
- **Create Item:** A simple form (or modal) to add a new item with the essential fields.  
- **Update Item:** An "Edit" button on each row that allows modification of an item's details.  
- **Delete Item:** A "Delete" button on each row with a confirmation step (Are you sure?).  
  
### 3. The "Low Stock" Alert:  
- Items in the table should be visually highlighted (e.g., a yellow or red background) if their quantity falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 10 units).  
  
## Stretch Goals (For the Innovators)  
Once the MVP is solid, push the boundaries:  
- **Data Visualization:** Add a simple bar or pie chart showing item quantities by category.  
- **Image Uploads:** Allow users to upload a product image when creating/editing an item.  
- **Bulk Operations:** Implement "batch delete" using checkboxes on the table.  
- **Activity Log:** A small panel showing the last 5-10 actions taken (e.g., "Item 'T-Shirt' created").
