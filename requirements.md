# MVP Requirements (The "Must-Haves")

## 1. The Dashboard View
- Key Stats: Header showing Total Unique Items, Items Low on Stock, and Items Out of Stock.
- Inventory Table: Clean, sortable table displaying all items.
- Essential Columns: Name, SKU, Category, Price, Quantity.
- Search & Filter: Single search bar to filter the table in real-time.

## 2. Core CRUD Functionality
- Create Item: Form or modal to add a new item with essential fields.
- Update Item: "Edit" button on each row to modify item details.
- Delete Item: "Delete" button on each row with confirmation step.

## 3. Low Stock Alert
- Items visually highlighted if quantity falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 10 units).

# Stretch Goals (Optional)
- Data Visualization: Bar or pie chart showing item quantities by category.
- Image Uploads: Allow product image upload when creating/editing an item.
- Bulk Operations: Implement batch delete using checkboxes on the table.
- Activity Log: Panel showing last 5-10 actions taken (e.g., item created/updated/deleted).
